Terraform-aws-ecs-app-worker is an AWS ECS Application Module for Workers without Application Load Balancer(ALB).

This module is designed to be used with `DNXLabs/terraform-aws-ecs` (https://github.com/DNXLabs/terraform-aws-ecs).

The following resources will be created:
 
 - Cloudwatch Metrics alarm - Provides a CloudWatch Metric Alarm resource.
   - High memory
   - High cpu
 - IAM roles - The cloudwatch event needs an IAM Role to run the ECS task definition. A role is created and a policy will be granted via IAM policy.
 - ECS task definition - A task definition is required to run Docker containers in Amazon ECS. Some of the parameters you can specify in a task definition include:
      - Image - Docker image to deploy.
           - Default value is "dnxsolutions/nginx-hello:latest"
      - CPU - Hard limit of the CPU for the container
           -  Default Value = 0
      - Memory - Hard memory of the container
           -  Default Value = 512
      - Name - Name of the ECS Service
      - Set log configuration
 - ECS Task-scheduler activated by cloudwatch events

In addition you have the option to create or not :

 - Simple Notification Service (SNS) topics - Alarm topics to create and alert on ECS service metrics. Leaving empty disables all alarms.
 - Cloudwatch Log Groups   
      - You can specify the number of days you want to retain log events in the specified log group. Possible values are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 365, 400, 545, 731, 1827, and 3653.
      - Export to a S3 Bucket - Whether to mark the log group to export to an S3 bucket (needs the module terraform-aws-log-exporter (https://github.com/DNXLabs/terraform-aws-log-exporter) to be deployed in the account/region)
